Facebook Testing
================

FbTesting lets you work with Facebook test users. It can be used to
create, delete, and friend test users and find login URLs.

Right now test users are still very unstable and slow. When you have hundreds
of test users the control panel can become unusable. Using the API is
the only solution until FB fixes these issues.

For use see examples and tests.

Tested on NodeJS v0.6.x branch.

Copy config.sample.js to config.js and edit values. This file isn't required but makes things easier.

There are bugs. Scope is wrong in a number of places. Don't like it? Fork, fix, pull request. ;)
