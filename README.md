Facebook Testing
================

FbApp lets you work with Facebook test users. For use see examples and tests.

Tested on NodeJS v0.6.x branch.

Copy config.sample.js to config.js and edit values. This file isn't required but makes things easier.

There are bugs. Scope is wrong in a number of places. Don't like it? Fork, fix, pull request. ;)
